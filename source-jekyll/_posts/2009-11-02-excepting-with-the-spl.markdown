In my opinion  proper use of error handling within an application is the mark of seasoned, professional developer. It is far too often that I see code that explodes on every error or, even worse, does not consider that errors will occur during runtime. 

One area that I like to make use of exceptions is unexpected input, especiallyin terms of function/method arguments. A lot of times the standard practice seems to be to return _FALSE_ for invalid input, but the boolean value false should be reserved for boolean indication. Likewise, _NULL_ should have a special connotation, semantically speaking.

In this first example, a repository (or mapper) is attempting to find a user with an id—let's assume it is a database id—that should be an integer. (_This code uses the Zend_Db_Table component to abstract queries, etc._)

[code language="php"]class UserRepository implements IRepository { public function fetchById($id) { $data = $this->getDbTable() ->find($id) ->current();

if (null === $data) { return null; }

return new User($data->toArray()); } }[/code]

Notice there is no validation performed on the _$id_ parameter which is pushed directly into the database table query. Granted the _Zend_Db_ component will handle this error with minimal pain, i.e., you should be fairly protected against a SQL injection attack, but you know that your database table uses an integer for the ID column thus your application should only respond positively to an  integer value for _$id_.

[code language="php"]public function fetchById($id) { if (!is_int($id)) {
return false; } //…snip }[/code]

My first attempt (above) at validation uses the native _is_int()_ validation function to check if the value supplied for _$id_ is an integer. If it is not the function returns false. There is plenty of precedent behind using the value _FALSE_ as the error state, but it is **blatantly not semantic**. _FALSE_ is obviously not the user object I asked for, but it does not indicate what went wrong.

Finally, I decide to use the _Zend_Validate_ component—for this trivial example it may be overkill, but it does the job nonetheless—to validate my input parameter for the user's ID property. Also notice that I am now throwing an exception object, specifically an _InvalidArgumentException_.

[code language="php"]public function fetchById($id) { $validator = new
Zend_Validate_Int(); if (!$validator->isValid($id)) { throw new
InvalidArgumentException( 'User ID must be an integer. ); } //…snip }[/code]

The _InvalidArgumentException_ exception is [one of many](http://www.php.net/manual/en/spl.exceptions.php) defined in the SPL as an extension of a logic exception. The reason for using such an exception class would be to improve the readability and usefulness of client code. When I use the _UserRepository_ object, my client code will look as follows. When an invalid argument, i.e., a non integer is given to the _fetchById()_ method it is obvious which code path will execute.

[code language="php"]try { $repository = new UserRepository(); $user =
$repository->fetchById("jcarouth"); } catch(InvalidArgumentException $e) {
//we passed an invalid argument, i.e., a non-integer } catch(Exception $e) {
//some other }[/code]
