I'm currently reading through two of Uncle Bob's books: [CleanCode](http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/) and [The Clean Coder](http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Coder-Conduct-Professional-Programmers/dp/0137081073/). Both are excellent reads, full of wisdom and advice that every person that calls himself or herself a developer should wield and heed on a daily basis. Readingthe first three chapters of The Clean Coder makes me realize professionalism is a behavior. It seems obvious, but I never thought about the gravity of the word, or the behavior.

To me, professionalism is a choice made each time a decision is required. Knowing when to say no and when to say yes is a hard choice. Uncle Bob stresses that as professionals we must be able to recognize how to decide whether we can commit to a task or if the task is beyond our capabilities. That's always been a sticking point for me, and I know I must work on it.

I can't wait to get through the rest of The Clean Coder. It and The Pragmatic Programmer are on the list of required reading for current and future developers.
