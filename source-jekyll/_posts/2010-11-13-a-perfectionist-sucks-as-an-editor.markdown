This is part 5 of a series. [Read part 4](http://carouth.com/2010/11/12 /topics-and-content-doubt/) or [read part 1](http://carouth.com/2010/11/09/why-i-failed-at-blogging/).

Ask any author what the most tedious part of the writing process is, and you'll most likely hear that it is editing. After I finish writing something the absolute **last thing I want to do is go back and pick it apart**, but it is necessary.

However, there is a fine line between constructively editing and the destructive attempt to make it perfect. I read a job advertisement recently — no, I am not currently searching, I just came across it somewhere — that said the employer is looking for someone that **recognizes there is a difference between perfect and good enough** to ship. That resonated with me since it is always possible to find a better way to do or say something, but you will end up endlessly improving something if you are not careful.

What makes a blog post good enough? I draw the line at **clear and concise**. If the message is not muddled in the back story or examples then publish that bad boy. There is no sense in sitting on the information. But, and it's a big but, this **doesn't mean you should publish posts that are inaccurate**.

Don't get caught in the trap of erring on the side of lazy. Do your homework. **Get the facts straight. Then publish.** Don't fret for hours over whether you should combine two sentences; it's the Internet.

Over time your writing will improve and it will be easier and easier to get it right the first time. Until then, just **make it good enough**.
