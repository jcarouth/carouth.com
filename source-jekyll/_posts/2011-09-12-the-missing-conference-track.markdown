This past weekend I attended [PyTexas 2011](http://www.pytexas.org/2011/). It was a great conference—even for someone that doesn't regularly use Python. It was enlightening to be the "noob" at a particular subject to gain a vantage point that I would otherwise be without.

Note: I'm not knocking on PyTexas at all. It was organized well and the sessions I attended were informative. However, in talking with a couple attendees and presenters I noticed something that hadn't dawned on me before, and is particularly relevant as I am helping organize a conference schedule and also hope to present at more conferences in the future. (Shameless plug to both [HTML5.tx](http://html5tx.com) and [ZendCon2011](http://zendcon.com/2011).)

The one thing missing from this conference was the intermediate level. There were talks and activities aimed at pure beginners as well as sessions that were clearly for advanced developers. I think that is great. But, in my case in particular, what I needed was something in between.

I attended talks in each of the available levels, and my suspicions were confirmed: the beginner talks were too below my abilities, and the advanced talks had content that won't fully grasp for a few weeks of working with Python. You might wonder what an intermediate-level session might look like. Well, me too. I have some ideas though.

Coming this conference as a (mostly) PHP developer, there were obviously some differences in language features, but, more importantly, there was a language barrier in terms of definitions of features. I heard a lot about "decorators"—which, incindentally are a really awesome feature—but I had to spend significant energy figuring out what a "Python decorator" was, which left me behind in most of the advanced talks that glossed over them.

One particular talk idea would be, as a general concept, Python development lingo. This would obviously require someone that has enough knowledge of other languages to point out examples if there are any. On a more specific level, Python for PHP/JAVA/C++/Ruby developers talks—open space idea rightthere—would be great.

Another idea for such an intermediate session would be focusing on particular programming paradigms. For example, Object-Oriented Programming in Pythonwould fit in this category. A talk of this persuasion would allow me to use my previous knowledge of programming with a concrete parallel into Python.

Anyway, that's my little "lightning post" on what I'd love to see at language-specific conferences. It would make them more accessible to those wanting to learn who are not total beginners to programming in general.
