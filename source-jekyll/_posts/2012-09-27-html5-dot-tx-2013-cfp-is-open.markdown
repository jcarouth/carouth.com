Last year I was one of the volunteers that helped organize HTML5.tx 2011 in Austin, Texas. The event was very successful and I couldn't have been more proud to have played a part in it.

We are putting on the next edition of the conference--it will take place on February 2, 2013--and I am pleased to announce the Call for Proposals is now open for your submissions. This year we have several speakers that are already committed to speak at the event and we have saved slots for you to speak. We want to hear from the community so this is your chance.

Submissions will be accepted starting today and running through October 28, 2012 at 11:59:59 p.m. Submit as many proposals as you'd like. We have reserved slots for full sessions (50 minutes in length) and are introducing a new format this year composed of three 10-minute talks back to back. This is a play on "lightning talks" and is aimed to give new presenters an opportunity to give a less stressful session on a more focused topic. However, if you're an experienced speaker with a great idea for a 10-minute talk, please submit one.

Along the lines of wanting to encourage new presenters, this year we want to offer a sort-of mentorship opportunity. Members of the HTML5.tx organizer team have volunteered to help mentor any speaker that might wish to speak at the event but needs a little help developing his or her topic or slides. We will be available for questions or to review anything you might need help with. Please don't let fear keep you from submitting a proposal.

I can't wait to see what you want to talk about. Submit today at [http://bit.ly/cfp-2013](http://bit.ly/cfp-2013).
