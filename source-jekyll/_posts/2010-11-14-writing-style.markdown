This is part 6 of a series. [Read part 5](http://carouth.com/2010/11/13/a

1](http://carouth.com/2010/11/09/why-i-failed-at-blogging/).

When I think about authors that I love and hate, it usually comes down to his
or her writing style. For example, I cannot stand essays, books, articles,
etc. that are composed of many short, choppy sentences. I always feel like I'm
reading a See Spot Run™ story. Because of this, I have adopted a more verbose
style.

**Being verbose has serious drawbacks**. A vast majority of the time I end up having to cut sentences and even paragraphs because I've gone off on some tangent and made my simple blog post a 3,000-word essay. That reminds me of a time…just kidding, no tangent to see here; move along.  
This impacted my blogging because **I ended up deleting a lot of posts I
started** that ended up much longer than anyone would be likely to read. I
don't mean to say that every post must be short. Rather, a post should only
**cover enough material to convey the intended message**, and it should do so
as concisely as possible. There's that word again: concise.

The way I plan to get over this real hurdle is to plan my posts better. With
pre-writing exercises I can keep myself on topic and avoid adding what ends up
being filler content. After all, I want this to be **a blog of quality rather
than a blog of quantity**. Actually I'd like both.

This concludes the Why I failed at blogging series. I hope I helped you get
over your hurdles, whether real or imagined. Let me know what hurdles you have
to overcome.
