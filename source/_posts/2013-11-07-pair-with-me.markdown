You may notice a big, blue botton in the sidebar of this page. That button takes you to a web form that simply says "ask me a question." There are some suggested topics, but really you could ask me whatever you wanted.

## What is this?

I would like to be able to say this was my idea. I would like to. But that would be a lie.

Someone who is clearly much more clever than me came up with the idea for [PairProgramWith.me](http://www.pairprogramwith.me/) and I am simply a follower at this point. Simply put this is a nice way to say that I am willing to help--and, frankly, be helped--by setting up some pair programming with the fine folks of the internet. If you take a second to read the site I linked to you will realize that this is imply a gesture. An open invitatioin.

## How does it work?

That's really up to you. My idea for this is to pair it--no pun intended--with my efforts with [PHPMentoring](http://phpmentoring.org) and schedule some time to get into the code with members of the PHP community. It really is that simple.

## Let's try it out

I invite you to try this out. Put the button on your blog. Spread the word. Set up some time with me. Do whatever you have to do, but get connected with someone so you can share your knowledge with eachother. We're in this together to learn. Let's make awesome things happen.
