This is part 5 of a series. [Read part 4](http://carouth.com/2010/11/12

1](http://carouth.com/2010/11/09/why-i-failed-at-blogging/).

Ask any author what the most tedious part of the writing process is, and
you'll most likely hear that it is editing. After I finish writing something
the absolute **last thing I want to do is go back and pick it apart**, but it
is necessary.

However, there is a fine line between constructively editing and the
destructive attempt to make it perfect. I read a job advertisement recently —
no, I am not currently searching, I just came across it somewhere — that said
the employer is looking for someone that **recognizes there is a difference
between perfect and good enough** to ship. That resonated with me since it is
always possible to find a better way to do or say something, but you will end
up endlessly improving something if you are not careful.

What makes a blog post good enough? I draw the line at **clear and concise**.
If the message is not muddled in the back story or examples then publish that
bad boy. There is no sense in sitting on the information. But, and it's a big
but, this **doesn't mean you should publish posts that are inaccurate**.

Don't get caught in the trap of erring on the side of lazy. Do your homework.
**Get the facts straight. Then publish.** Don't fret for hours over whether
you should combine two sentences; it's the Internet.

Over time your writing will improve and it will be easier and easier to get it
right the first time. Until then, just **make it good enough**.
