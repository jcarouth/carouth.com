At [ZendCon 2013](http://zendcon.com) I had a conversation with [a friend](https://twitter.com/steverhoades) about Domain Driven Design. He had just given his first presentation about DDD at the uncon and the topic quickly shifted to the Blue Book vs the Red Book.

After some more discussions with other developers interested in Domain Driven Design, I have decided to facilitate an online discussion group to read through the book [Implementing Domain-Driven by Vaughn Vernon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BCLEBN8/). 

## The Plan

I would like to hold these discussions using Google+ hangouts which would allow them to be recorded and shared on Youtube for anyone to listen to them in the future.

I think a reasonable time to start is the end of this month or the early part of next month which would give people time to pick up the book and read the first section for discussion.

I am going to schedule the first meetup for *January 28th at 8 p.m. CST (-0600)*. The time and date are open to discussion, leave a comment and we can get a general consensus for a time that works better if this one does not work for you.

## The subject

The first discussion will center around Chapter 1 of the book, Getting started with DDD. This is a relatively good introduction topic and should be fairly easy for everyone to digest regardless of their experience with DDD as of yet.

## Interested?

If you're interested in joining, leave a comment here, find me on [Google+](https://plus.google.com/+JeffCarouth/) or [send me a tweet](http://twitter.com/jcarouth) and I'll get you added to the list.
