This is part 4 of a series. [Read part 3](http://carouth.com/2010/11/11/time/)
or [read part 1](http://carouth.com/2010/11/09/why-i-failed-at-blogging/).

I've heard this one a lot, and I've used it myself quite a few times. It
usually goes something like this, "I have no idea what to write about," or,
"Everything I start to write about has already been covered by people much
smarter than me." Wait, did I just admit there is one person smarter than me?
Crazy.

**The Internet does have everything on it**. There is no topic that has not been hashed to death in one form or another. (Okay maybe one or two, but that doesn't work with my post, so I'll ignore it.) There is one thing that I can _guarantee_ is not on the Internet until you post it on your blog: your opinion, take, two-cents, etc. on 100% of the topics you refuse to post about. I know that's the case with me.  
So what do I write about? Good question, glad you asked. Anything. I mentioned
it earlier, but for continual readership you're going to have to come up with
some consistency in topic, but, especially if you are just starting out, you
have free reign to **find what your friends, followers, and colleagues want to
hear from you**.

Start out with reviews of projects and tools you are using, or issues you have
with your code or environment and how you solve them. Get some posts up, get
the word out, and see what works for you.

I can't tell you what to do after you've figured out your go-to topic because
I haven't yet found mine. But I will. Soon.
