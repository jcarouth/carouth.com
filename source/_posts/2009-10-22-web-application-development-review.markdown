A Marketing Research Executive from [Packt Publishing](http://www.packtpub.com/) contacted me several days ago about reviewing a recently (September 2009) released book by [Keith Pope](http://www.thepopeisdead.com/) entitled [Zend Framework 1.8 Web Application Development](http://www.packtpub.com/zend-framework-1-8-web-application-development/book). I am honored to be considered a developer with enough knowledge of the Zend Framework to offer my thoughts and opinions on such a book. Since I already read Mr. Pope's blog I've followed along during the writing process and cannot wait to read the actual book. 

Keith [posted a sample chapter](http://www.thepopeisdead.com/main/comments/free_chapter_and_more_to_come/) of the book on his blog if you are interested. Otherwise, stay tuned for my review!
