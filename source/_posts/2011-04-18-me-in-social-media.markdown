In some recent discussions, the topic of individualism and employer identity in the social media realm has been a focal point. In other words we have questions if a person can have a social media presence in which he or she is not speaking for his or her employer, or, at a lower level, his or her comments do not reflect on the employer.

The idea of "personal brand," is something that I take issue with. In my opinion, saying you have a personal brand is syntactic sugar for saying you have an identity. I made this comment on Twitter:

    "I'm not a brand. I'm a person."

(Don't worry about the hash tag, it's not important.)

In further discussions we've touched on whether one can truly separate his orher personal life from a career. In my opinion, absolutely. My approach to social media separates the various platforms and caters to a specific audience on each. Here's a couple and how I use them.

[Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/jcarouth): Personal interaction with family and friends. I don't post very serious content here, it's more a playground where my laid-back personality can thrive.

[Twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/jcarouth): I use this mainly for professional contacts with some personal connections and interactions. I must admit I've slacked off in the past year or so, and as such, Twitter has lost a significant amount of value to me.

[Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jcarouth): This is where I post photos for my photography hobby. I also stay in touch--or sometimes it seems more like stalking--other photographers that interest me.

[YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/jcarouth): I rarely, if ever, contribute, but I do use this for gear reviews and general knowledge building.

[LinkedI](http://www.linkedin.com/in/jcarouth)n: Purely used a collection of professional contacts for career-oriented networking.

[Foursquare](https://foursquare.com/user/5038267): I haven't really ever gotten into this. While I understand the idea, it seems rather creepy to know where someone is at all times and then to be alerted when your friends/acquaintances are nearby.

As you can see, I keep each medium completely separate. I don't believe that tying your status message to populate the same message on every social media outlet is a good idea, nor do I feel it provides value to your followers. Again, this is purely my opinion.

What I'm getting at is you are an idividual. Who you work for is only a small component of your identity, and it is completely possible to separate your personal life from your professional life.

One technique I'm going to try out is having a separate account for my work-focused identity. On Twitter, I will have an account[@jcarouth](http://twitter.com/#!/jcarouth) for my personal identity and[@JeffAtTAMU](http://twitter.com/#!/JeffAtTAMU) for my [Texas A&M;University](http://www.tamu.edu)-related tweets. I'm going to be tweetingabout what I do at Texas A&M; and hopefully contributing to the Aggie community, even if it's a small contribution.
