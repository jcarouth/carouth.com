No, I'm not going to inundate you with quotes of famous and not-so-famous
people about how stepping out of your comfort zone will revolutionize your
life. Instead, I'd like to simply encourage you to step out of your box every
once in a while if for no other reason than the potential to learn something.

## What is My Comfort Zone?

The absolute first step in this technique for improvement is to figure out
where you comfort zone is. For a lot of the people the knee-jerk answer is in
whatever language they are currently using. This is not a bad answer but it
will most likely lead to a shallow experience. For example, my obvious comfort
zone is in PHP development. To step outside my comfort zone, then, I'd merely
need to read through someone else's project written in Python or even Ruby and
then pat myself on the back for each concept or technique I can extract from
such projects. However, doing so doesn't really answer the question what is my
comfort zone and doesn't force me to get outside of it.

My real comfort zone could be working with a relational database or even using
scripting languages. I could easily follow the noSQL revolution for a sample
project or work on a project written in, e.g., .NET using C#. These
technologies are so different from my normal tools that I'd be forced to think
about problems and solutions in a different light.

## Different Technologies, Different Approaches

Working with differing technologies is not guaranteed to help at all. In fact
the experience can be extremely frustrating because you will come across
innovative solutions that simply won't be possible in your "home" environment
because of language or technology barriers. This is natural and should be
expected. If this weren't the case we wouldn't have such a deep pool of
languages to chose from.

Instead of focusing on the negative, keep digging into the project. Given
enough time you should be able to find a few concepts from the new environment
that you can either adopt or at least adapt into projects in your preferred
languages and tools. In my case I inherited a few projects that are written in
.NET. Instead of immediately grumbling about how awful it is to work in that
environment, I've embraced it and gone on some bug hunting/fixing expeditions
through the code. As a result I've learned quite a bit about how another
developer uses a different technology to accomplish some of the same tasks.

## Read Other Developers' Code

This leads me to the final benefit of stepping out of your personal
playground: you get to read other developer's code. I don't remember where but
I recently read a comment in which the author stated that it's silly for a
developer to assume he or she can continue to expand his or her knowledge
without reading peer code. He or she went on to say that this is like a person
deciding to become an author without ever reading other works.

At first I resisted the notion that an author must read other's work before
becoming a talented author. After all, it's quite possible that a person can
be naturally gifted. However, the underlying meaning became apparent. We all
must learn ways that work and some ways that do not. Without seeing a variety
of approaches there will be no growth. This does not mean that you must
immediately adopt what you read. You should look for similarities to your own
work as much as you find differences.

## A Real-life Example

Like a lot of other web developers I've always held contempt for JavaScript.
It's a language that was once far outside my comfort zone. However, the Dojo
framework came along and converted me. Using and reading through the code led
me to appreciate all the nuances I once despised about the JavaScript
language. I listened to talks on the language's history, I learned some of the
advanced techniques and concepts presented by [Douglas
Crockford](http://www.crockford.com/), [John Resig](http://ejohn.org/), et
cetera, and then I read the specs for upcoming versions of PHP. I had
unknowingly adopted some of the functional programming techniques and concepts
prevalent in JavaScript and now I could apply them to my PHP projects.

Stepping out of my comfort zone was one of the most influential decisions I've
made. I hope you will take some time to do the same.
