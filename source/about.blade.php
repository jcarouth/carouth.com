    <h1>About Jeff Carouth</h1>

    <div class="max-w-3xl">
        <p>Howdy! (That's Texan for "hello".) I am Jeff and I have been a professional developer for about 16 years depending on how you define professional. You can find me all over the internet using the extremely creative moniker, jcarouth. I am a software developer working primarily on the web and spend my days leading product development teams. I am based in College Station, Texas, home of <a class="underline" href="https://www.tamu.edu">Texas A&M University</a>.</p>

        <h2>Mentoring</h2>

        <p>
            I have a passion for helping other people develop themselves to reach their professional goals. Over the years I have been mentored by some very smart people, both formally and informally, and, in turn, hope that I have been a guiding force in lives of others I have collaborated with.
        </p>

        <p>
            Some topics I have worked with people on in the past include testing, systems design, software architecture, product development leadership, development process (build tools, software quality, etc.,) among others.
        </p>

        <h2>Speaking</h2>

        <p>
            I have presented dozens of talks over the years ranging from introduction to features in upcoming versions of programming languages all the way through Domain Driven Design. Some of my favorite talks include JavaScript's Difficult Concepts Explained, Testing Essentials: Mock Objects Explained, and Dependency Injection, Dependency Inversion, and You.
        </p>

        <h2>The Dev Book Club</h2>

        <p>
            In 2014 I started an online book club for developers to read through and discuss technical books. We started with Implementing Domain Driven Design by Vaughn Vernon. The purpose of this club is to provide a real-time resource for participants to be able to gain many perspectives while reading potentially challenging subject matter as well as a long-living resource for anyone approaching these topics to listen to several perspectives.
        </p>

        <p>
            After reading IDDD the club started working through Clean Code by Robert Martin, but participation trailed off and I let it die out. In 2021 I rebooted the club as interest in being able to host these kinds of discussions grew again.

        <h2>The Loosely Coupled Podcast</h2>

        <p>
            I started a podcast and quickly partnered with Matt Frost. Together we produced 28 episodes in 2014 and 2015. For more on the podcast visit <a class="underline"  href="https://www.looselycoupled.info">the Loosely Coupled podcast website</a>.
