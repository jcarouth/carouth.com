## Abstract

When approaching JavaScript as a PHP developer some of the nuances of the language take a while to become comfortable.

If you've ever wondered how context and the this keyword work, when to declare a variable, how to create objects and use prototypes in JavaScript, you are not alone. These concepts seems crazy at first, but with some examples you can grasp and use them in your code today.

This session will cover the finer points of JavaScript the language from the perspective of someone who is proficient with PHP or another language.
