## Abstract

You know testing is beneficial to your project. You are familiar with merits and caveats of test-driven development. But the project you’re hacking on right now is what most would call a legacy application. How do you apply your test knowledge to an application that doesn’t lend itself to traditional unit testing? The answer most will give is, “you don’t,” but we’re going to look at ways to write tests now that will allow you to improve and refactor your application to evolve the code to a more manageable state. The traditional “easy” route to dealing with legacy code is to rewrite but a little patience and skill applied to writing tests will yeild better results.
